## CSS

css is a stylesheet language that allows you to control the appearance of web pages. It enables you to create visually appealing web pages, user interfaces, and web applications.
it is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

## CSS Types
css can be written in three ways:
internal, external, and inline.
 
## 1. Internal CSS

Internal CSS involves writing styles directly within the HTML file using the `<style>` tag. This method is suitable for small-scale styling.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Internal CSS Example</title>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
    h1 {
      color: #333;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph with some content.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## 2. External CSS

External CSS involves placing the styles in a separate CSS file and linking it to the HTML document. This method is preferable for larger projects as it promotes better organization and reusability.

**CSS File (styles.css):**

```css
/* styles.css */

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
}
```

**HTML File:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>External CSS Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph with some content.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## 3. Inline CSS

Inline CSS involves applying styles directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute. This method is useful for styling specific elements.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Inline CSS Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="color: #333;">Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This is a paragraph with some content.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## 4. Import CSS

The `@import` rule allows you to import an external CSS file into another CSS file. This method is similar to external linking but is done within a CSS file.

**Main CSS File (main.css):**

```css
/* main.css */

@import url("styles.css");

/* Additional styles for this document */
body {
  margin: 20px;
}
```

**HTML File:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Import CSS Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph with some content.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## 5. Linking CSS from CDN

You can link to CSS files hosted on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) directly from your HTML file.

**Example (Linking to Bootstrap from CDN):**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>CDN CSS Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```




## CSS Syntax

CSS syntax consists of selectors and declaration blocks. Selectors target HTML elements, while declaration blocks contain property-value pairs. Multiple declaration blocks can be grouped into a rule set.

```css

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

Selectors can be broadly categorized into:

- **Type Selector:** Selects all elements of a specific type, like `p` for paragraphs. This is the most basic selector. It can be used to target all elements of a specific type, such as `p` for paragraphs, `h1` for headings, or `div` for divisions. 
- **Class Selector:** Selects elements with a specific class, like `.class-name`. This is a more advanced selector. It can be used to target elements with a specific class, such as `.primary` or `.secondary`.    
- **ID Selector:** Selects a unique element with a specific ID, like `#id-name`. This is a more advanced selector. It can be used to target a unique element with a specific ID, such as `#header` or `#footer`. 
- **Attribute Selector:** Selects elements based on their attributes, like `[attribute=value]`. This is a more advanced selector. It can be used to target elements based on their attributes, such as `[type="text"]` or `[href="https://example.com"]`.  
- **Descendant Selector:** Selects all descendants of a specified ancestor. This is a more advanced selector. It can be used to target all descendants of a specified ancestor, such as `div p` or `ul li`. 
- **Child Selector:** Selects direct children of a parent. This is a more advanced selector. It can be used to target direct children of a parent, such as `div > p` or `ul > li`. 
- **Adjacent Sibling Selector:** Selects an element that is directly preceded by a specified element. This is a more advanced selector. It can be used to target an element that is directly preceded by a specified element, such as `h1 + p` or `h2 + p`. 
- **General Sibling Selector:** Selects all siblings of a specified element. This is a more advanced selector. It can be used to target all siblings of a specified element, such as `h1 ~ p` or `h2 ~ p`. 

## CSS Colors

Colors in CSS can be specified using predefined names, HEX, RGB, RGBA, HSL, or HSLA values. The `color` property controls the text color, while `background-color` controls the background color of an element. The `border-color` property controls the color of an element's border.  

```css
color: red;
color: #00ff00;
color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);
color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%);
color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
```

Understanding color in CSS involves considering properties like `color` (text color), `background-color`, and border-related properties (`border-color`). 

## CSS Backgrounds

Background properties control the background of elements, including color, image, and positioning.  

```css
background-color: #f0f0f0;
background-image: url("background.jpg");
background-repeat: repeat-x;
background-position: center;
background-size: cover;
```

In addition to the basics, background properties like `background-attachment` and `background-origin` can be explored for more advanced styling. 

## CSS Borders

Borders are applied to the edges of elements and can have various styles, colors, and widths. 

```css
border: 1px solid #000;
border-radius: 10px;
border-top: 2px dashed #333;
```

Understanding the `border` shorthand and individual properties like `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color` is essential. The `border-radius` property controls the curvature of borders. 

## CSS Margins

Margins create space outside an element's border, pushing adjacent elements away. css margin property is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). 

```css
margin: 10px;
margin-top: 20px;
margin-right: 15px;
margin-bottom: 5px;
margin-left: 0;
```

Margins are crucial for controlling the spacing between elements. The `margin` shorthand and individual margin properties (`margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`) offer fine-grained control. 

## CSS Padding

Padding creates space inside an element, separating its content from the border. css padding property is used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left). 

```css
padding: 10px;
padding-top: 20px;
padding-right: 15px;
padding-bottom: 5px;
padding-left: 0;
```

Padding is crucial for maintaining content spacing within elements. The `padding` shorthand and individual padding properties (`padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`) offer control over internal spacing.

## CSS Box Model

The CSS box model comprises content, padding, border, and margin. The `width` and `height` properties control the size of the content box. The `padding` property controls the space between the content and border. The `border` property controls the border of an element. The `margin` property controls the space between elements.

```css
width: 200px;
height: 150px;
```

Understanding the box model is fundamental to crafting layouts in CSS. The `width` and `height` properties control the size of the content box.

## CSS Display

The `display` property defines the display behavior of an element. 

```css
display: block;
display: inline;
display: inline-block;
display: none;
```

The `display` property determines how elements flow in the document. Understanding block-level, inline, and inline-block elements is essential for layout design.

## CSS Positioning

The `position` property controls the positioning method of an element.  

```css
position: static;
position: relative;
position: absolute;
position: fixed;
```

Understanding the different positioning values (`static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`) is crucial for precise layout control. The `relative` positioning is often used as a building block for more complex layouts.

## CSS Float

The `float` property specifies whether an element should be placed to the left or right of its container. css float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container. The `clear` property controls the behavior of elements after a floating element.

```css
float: left;
float: right;
```

Floating elements can be used for creating layouts where elements flow around each other. However, it's important to understand how floating affects the document flow and how to clear floats.

## CSS Flexbox

Flexbox is a layout model that allows the design of a container's items based on flexible boxes. css flexbox is a layout module for arranging and aligning elements on the page such that the design is flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes and devices. The `display` property is set to `flex` to enable flexbox. The `flex` property controls the size of flex items. The `flex-direction` property controls the direction of flex items. The `justify-content` property controls the alignment of flex items along the main axis. The `align-items` property controls the alignment of flex items along the cross axis.

```css
display: flex;
justify-content: space-between;
align-items: center;
```

Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating flexible and responsive layouts. Understanding properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex` is crucial for effective use.

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. css grid layout is a layout module that arranges elements into columns and rows. The `display` property is set to `grid` to enable CSS Grid. The `grid-template-columns` property controls the columns of the grid. The `grid-template-rows` property controls the rows of the grid. The `grid-gap` property controls the spacing between grid items.

```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
grid-gap: 10px;
```

CSS Grid provides a grid-based layout system, allowing precise control over both rows and columns. Exploring properties like 
` grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `grid-gap` enables advanced layout design.

## CSS Fonts

Font properties control the typeface, size, and style of text. css font property is used to specify the font size, font weight, font family, and the font style of the text content of an element. The `font-family` property controls the font family. The `font-size` property controls the font size. The `font-weight` property controls the font weight. The `font-style` property controls the font style. 

```css
font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
font-size: 16px;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: italic;
```

Understanding how to set the font family and style, as well as properties like `font-size` and `font-weight`, is crucial for text presentation.

## CSS Text

Text-related properties handle the appearance and behavior of text. css text property is used to specify the text style, text color, text alignment, text decoration, text transformation, text shadow, and text indent. The `color` property controls the text color. The `line-height` property controls the line height. The `text-align` property controls the text alignment. The `text-decoration` property controls the text decoration.

```css
color: #333;
line-height: 1.5;
text-align: center;
text-decoration: underline;
```

Properties like `color`, `line-height`, `text-align`, and `text-decoration` contribute to effective text styling.

## CSS Links

Link styling involves setting the appearance of hyperlinks. css link property is used to specify the style of links, including link color, link hover color, and link visited color. The `color` property controls the link color. The `text-decoration` property controls the text decoration of links. The `:hover` pseudo-class controls the link hover color.

```css
a {
  color: #0077cc;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

Ensuring a consistent and visually appealing link style is crucial for user experience.

## CSS Lists

List styling involves the presentation of ordered and unordered lists. css list property is used to specify the style of lists, including list item marker, list item marker color, and list item marker position. The `list-style-type` property controls the list item marker. The `list-style-position` property controls the list item marker position.

```css
ul {
  list-style-type: square;
}

ol {
  list-style-type: decimal;
}
```

Customizing the appearance of lists, such as changing the list item marker or counter style, can enhance the overall design.

## CSS Tables

Table styling involves controlling the appearance of tables. css table property is used to specify the style of tables, including table border, table cell padding, and table cell text alignment. The `border-collapse` property controls the table border. The `padding` property controls the table cell padding. The `text-align` property controls the table cell text alignment.

```css
table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

td,
th {
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 8px;
  text-align: left;
}
```

Creating visually appealing and responsive tables requires understanding properties like `width`, `border-collapse`, and styling table cells (`td` and `th`).

## CSS Transitions

Transitions create smooth animations between property changes. css transition property is used to specify the style of transitions, including transition property, transition duration, and transition timing function. The `transition` property controls the transition property, duration, and timing function.

```css
transition: width 0.5s ease-in-out;
```

Understanding how to use the `transition` property, specifying the property to transition, duration, and timing function, adds interactivity to web pages.

## CSS Animations

Animations allow the creation of complex motion effects. css animation property is used to specify the style of animations, including animation name, animation duration, and animation timing function. The `animation` property controls the animation name, duration, and timing function. 

```css
@keyframes slide {
  from {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
}

.element {
  animation: slide 1s ease-in-out;
}
```

Creating animations involves defining keyframes and applying them using the `animation` property.

## CSS Transformations

Transformations modify the appearance of an element in 2D or 3D space. css transform property is used to specify the style of transformations, including rotation, scaling, and translation. The `transform` property controls the transformation type and value.

```css
transform: rotate(45deg);
```

Understanding transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and translation, can bring dynamic effects to web elements.

## CSS Responsive Design

Responsive design ensures that web pages look good on devices with varying screen sizes. css responsive design is a design approach that ensures web pages look good on devices with varying screen sizes. Media queries are used to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or browser.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  /* Styles for smaller screens */
}
```

Media queries play a key role in making designs adapt to different devices. Understanding how to use media queries is essential for creating responsive layouts.

## CSS Media Queries

Media queries apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or browser. css media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true. Media queries are used to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or browser.

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for larger screens */
}
```

Utilizing media queries for responsive design involves setting breakpoints and adjusting styles accordingly.

## CSS Variables

CSS variables store and reuse property values. css variable is a container for a value that can be reused throughout a CSS file. Variables are declared using the `--` prefix and accessed using the `var()` function.

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
}

.element {
  color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

CSS variables enhance maintainability by centralizing key values. The `:root` selector is used to declare global variables.

## CSS Pseudo-classes

Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state or position. css pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). The `:hover` pseudo-class adds interactive styles to elements. The `:focus` pseudo-class adds styles to elements that have keyboard focus.

```css
input:focus {
  border-color: #ff0000;
}
```

Using pseudo-classes, like `:hover` or `:focus`, adds interactive styles to elements.

## CSS Pseudo-elements

Pseudo-elements style certain parts of an element. css pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). The `::first-line` pseudo-element allows styling the first line of an element.

```css
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Pseudo-elements, such as `::before` or `::after`, allow styling specific parts of an element.

## CSS Combinators

Combinators define the relationship between selectors. css combinator is a character that specifies the relationship between selectors. The descendant combinator (` `) selects all descendants of a specified ancestor. The child combinator (`>`) selects direct children of a parent. The adjacent sibling combinator (`+`) selects an element that is directly preceded by a specified element. The general sibling combinator (`~`) selects all siblings of a specified element.

```css
h2 + p {
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```

Understanding combinators, like the adjacent sibling combinator (`+`) or the general sibling combinator (`~`), enables precise targeting of elements. 

## CSS Specificity

Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when conflicts arise. css specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector. The `!important` declaration overrides all other declarations. Inline styles override styles in external stylesheets. ID selectors have a higher specificity than class selectors. Class selectors have a higher specificity than type selectors. Descendant selectors have a higher specificity than child selectors. Child selectors have a higher specificity than adjacent sibling selectors. Adjacent sibling selectors have a higher specificity than general sibling selectors.

```css
/* Higher specificity */
#content p {
  color: blue;
}

/* Lower specificity */
p {
  color: red;
}
```
